# Sudoku

Number Game that use 0 - 9 digit. The sudoku grid is composed of 9 rows, sometimes labeled 'A' to 'I', 9 columns labeled 1 to 9 and 9 boxes usually marked by heavier borders. A sudoku puzzle is solved when all the grid cells have been filled with numbers from 1 to 9 according to the following three rules:

    Each row must contain all numbers from 1 to 9.
    Each column must contain all numbers from 1 to 9.
    Each box must contain all numbers from 1 to 9.

It follows that any single number may appear only once in the same row, once in the same column and once in the same box, or in other words no number may appear more than once in a row, in a column or in a box.
